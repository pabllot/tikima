Every web developer needs to know how to build a Social Media Website. On this project I used React hooks best practices, Next.js, and TypeScript. 

The TikTok Clone App includes Google Auth, the ability to upload, publish, share, comment on, and like the videos; filtering by categories and advanced search functionalities, profile pages, suggested accounts, custom responsive design, and much more.
